# 1. Introduction

## 1.1. Overview

What Is Heart Disease?

The term “heart disease” refers to several types of heart conditions. The most common type of heart disease in the United States is coronary artery disease (CAD), which affects the blood flow to the heart. Decreased blood flow can cause a heart attack.
Using Machine Learning Model, we can predict the human’s disease is defective or not by training model with the help of their dataset with major accuracy.


## 1.2. Motivation

The number of deaths due to cardiovascular diseases increased by 41% between 1990 and 2013, climbing from 12.3 million deaths to 17.3 million deaths in globally. In addition to that, half of the deaths in many developed countries are due to this issue. Therefore, early detection of heart diseases is required to reduce the health complications. Machine learning has been widely used in modern healthcare sector for diagnosing and predicting the presence of diseases using data models. Logistic regression is one such relatively used machine learning algorithms for complex diseases. Thus, identify the most significant model for cardiovascular diseases is predicting the overall risk by using logistic regression.

## 1.3. Scope of Work

- The system uses 14 medical parameters such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, and obesity for prediction.
- The Heart Disease Prediction System predicts the likelihood of patients getting heart disease.
- It enables significant knowledge, relationships between medical factors related to heart disease and patterns, to be established.


## 1.4. Objective

The objective of this study is to effectively predict if the patient suffers from heart disease. The health professional enters the input values from the patient's health report. The data is feed into model which predicts the probability of having heart disease.
