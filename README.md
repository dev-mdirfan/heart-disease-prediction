# Heart Disease Prediction

Heart Disease Prediction is the application of science and technology to predict the personâ€™s heart is defective or not for given their data set.  The correct prediction of heart disease can prevent life threats, and incorrect prediction can prove to be fatal at the same time. In this project different machine learning algorithms is applied to compare the results and analysis of the UCI Machine Learning Heart Disease dataset. The dataset consists of 14 main attributes used for performing the analysis. Various promising results are achieved and are validated using accuracy and confusion matrix. The dataset consists of some irrelevant features which are handled using Isolation Forest, and data are also normalized for getting better results. And how this study can be combined with some multimedia technology like mobile devices.
