# Conclusion and Future Enhancement

## Conclusion:

This project provides the overview into machine learning techniques for predicting heart diseases. The role of regression model is crucial in healthcare industry so that the results can be used for predicting the treatment which can be provided to patients. The existing techniques very good for finding the efficient and accurate systems. 
Machine learning techniques significantly improves accuracy of cardiovascular risk prediction through which patients can be identified during an early stage of disease and can be benefitted by preventive treatment. 
It can be concluded that there is a huge scope for machine learning algorithms in predicting cardiovascular diseases or heart related diseases.


## Future Enhancement:

Naïve Bayes was found to be the best algorithm, followed by neural networks and decision trees. 
Artificial neural networks are also employed for the prediction of diseases. Supervised networks have been used for diagnosis and they can be trained using the Back Propagation Algorithm.


## Limitations:

1. The accuracy can be more achieve by using Naïve Bayes. 
2. Deep Learning ANN are better for the prediction of diseases. Supervised networks have been used for diagnosis.
